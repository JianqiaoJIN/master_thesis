Anomaly Detection and Exploratory Causal Analysis for SAP HANA 
-----------------------------
Welcome. This repository contains the codes and implementations of my master thesis. My master thesis is mainly concentrated on two topics: anomaly detection for streaming data and Granger causality analysis among multivariate time series data. 


#### Anomaly Detection
An online algorithm called OPUAD (Online Prototypes Update Anomaly Detetion) is proposed to detect anomalies for streaming applications in an unsupervised, automated fashion without supervison, which makes it self-adaptive and computationally efficient. The algorithm is evaluated by the Numenta Anomaly Benchmark (NAB) https://github.com/numenta/NAB.
